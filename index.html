											<img src="images/banana.png" alt="bananas"/>
											<p>
												<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/likeaj6/FakeBananas"><strong>Fake Bananas</strong></a> is a fake news detector web app based on stance detection, natural language processing and machine learning.
												At HackMIT 2017, Fake Bananas finished in the top 10 teams out of over 400 teams and 1250 hackers. Fake Bananas also
												won Best AI/Hack for Social Good from Baidu and the prize for the Most Interesting Use of Data from Hudson River Trading. <br /><br />
												Our fake news detection is based on the concept of <strong><i>stance detection.</i></strong> Fake news is tough to identify. Many 'facts' are
												highly complex and difficult to check, or exist on a 'continuum of truth' or are compound sentences with act and fiction overlapping. The best way to
												attack this problem is not through fact checking, but by comparing how reputable sources feel about a claim.
											</p>
											<img class="image fit" src="images/fakebananas.png"  />
											<p>
												How FakeBananas works:
											</p>
											<p>
												<ol>
													<li>
														1. Users input a claim like <i>"The Afghanistan war was bad for the world"</i>
													</li>
													<li>
														2. Our program will search the thousands of global and local news sources for their 'stance' on that topic.
													</li>
													<li>
														3. We run sources through our Reputability Algorithm. If lots of reputable sources all agree with your claim, then it's probably true.
													</li>
													<li>
														4. Then we cite our sources so our users can click through and read more about that topic!
													</li>
												</ol>
												I was primarily in charge of web scraping for articles. Given a user URL or claim, I used Microsoft's Azure Cognitive and IBM's Natural Language Processing
												to parse the article or claim and perform keyword extraction. I then used combinations of the keywords to collect up to a few thousand articles
												from Event Registry's database to pass on to the machine learning model. Here I aired on the side of collecting more rather than fewer articles
												because the machine learning will accurately determine relevancy further in the pipeline. <br />
											</p>
											<p>
												Moving forward, we hope to launch a public facing web application and potentially even a browser plug-in that can detect
												news articles and display what our pipeline returns.

											<p>I built a <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/hanksterhan/NBA-Statistics-Scraper'>web scraper</a> that gathered statistical information from every active player in the NBA in the

											<p>
												Moving forward, I would like to analyze the data that I compiled and create a machine learning model that can predict roughly how well a player is going to do
												based on recent performances, offensive/defensive team metrics, and other statistics.

											<h2 class="major"><strong>Analysis of Feature Selection Across Different Machine Learning Algorithms</strong></h2>
											<p>
												For my machine learning class, my partner and I chose to do an analysis on how different machine learning algorithms handle feature selection and dimensionality reduction
												implicitly or explictly. We chose 4 machine learning models: support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and logistic regression with L1 and L2 norms. We compared the results to
												existing preprocessing techniques that are used for dimensionality reduction - Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The linear transformation using PCA
												is shown below.
											</p>
											<img src="images/education_PCA.png" class="image fit"/>
											<p>
												Abstract
											</p>
											<p>
												Feature importance and dimensionality reduction are important for effectively visualizing and interpreting real-world datasets,
												as well as improving prediction accuracy. Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data">Students Academic Performance Dataset from Kaggle</a>,
												we implemented support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and logistic regression with L1 and L2 norms. These algorithms with various hyperparamets were implemented
												to determine feature importance and predictive power of the models. These results were then compared to the important features determined from the preprocessing techniques:
												Principle Component Anaylsis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Using R<sup>2</sup> values, which explain the percentage of the response variable explained by the
												variation in the model, it was found that L1 regularized logistic regression and Bayesian networks best fit the data. The higher R<sup>2</sup> values identify that these algorithms
												had the most predictive power, allowing them to identify the ost important features in the dataset. SVM, LDA and L2 regularized logistic regression least accurately fit the data with
												SVM having the next highest R<sup>2</sup> value and L1 having the lowerst. The important features between Bayesian networks, PCA, and LDA were compared, while the irrelevant features
												determined by SVM and L1/L2 logistic regression were also evaluated.
											</p>
											<p>
												Moving forward, I would like to do more analysis in the sci-kit learn library feature_selection. I would also like to use multiple datasets and have more baselines to compare results to.

											<h2 class="major"><strong>Why You Need 12 Bananas Worth of Potassium Every Day</strong></h2>
											<p>
												Potassium is the third most abundant mineral in the body so it is no surprise that a potassium deficient diet can lead to a slew of problems.
												The most common symptoms of potassium deficiency include fatigue, muscle weakness, and brain fog. In addition, supplementing potassium has
												been proven to stimulate neural activities like memorization and learning, help lower blood pressure, and reduce stress and anxiety.
												Potassium plays a vital role in maintaining water balance in the body, and a sufficient concentration is also required for regular contraction
												and relaxation of muscles.To an extent, a state of potassium deficiency can be thought of as being intoxicated by alcohol - where both are
												characterized with poor muscle coordination, lapses in judgement, and potentially even poor memory. The daily recommended value is 4700mg
												- 12 bananas worth - of potassium, and I’m willing to bet that you’re not getting enough of it on a consistent basis.
